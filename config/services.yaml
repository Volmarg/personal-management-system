    # whenever this has to be changed, don't forget about adjusting frontend logic
    # as the fronted is silently updating the jwt token when user clicks on page to keep the user logged in.
    # The frontend code checks with each click on page if the jwt token has expired and if so - user is logged out
    # With this, the token is refreshed every "X" seconds so that user won't be logged out while just handling front
    # based page which don't have any ajax calls etc.
